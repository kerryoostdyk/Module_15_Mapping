# Module_15_Mapping

Overview

This project is a web application that visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The application uses JavaScript along with the Leaflet.js library to create an interactive map that displays earthquake locations. The map includes various layers, including a tectonic plate layer, and allows users to toggle these layers on and off.

Technologies Used

  JavaScript: Used for scripting and interactivity
  
  HTML: Structure of the web page
  
  Leaflet.js: For rendering the interactive map
  
  D3.js: For handling and loading the earthquake data
  
  USGS API: Data source for real-time earthquake information

Features

  Displays earthquake data on an interactive map
  
  Users can toggle different map layers (e.g., street, satellite, terrain views)
  
  Includes a tectonic plate layer for additional geological context
  
  Uses data fetched from the USGS API

Usage

  Interact with the map by zooming and panning.
  
  Toggle different layers using the control panel.
  
  View real-time earthquake data displayed as markers on the map.

Acknowledgments

  Leaflet.js for the mapping functionality
  
  D3.js for data manipulation
  
  USGS Earthquake API for providing earthquake data
